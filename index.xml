      <description>For this project I built several models to predict how much sales revenue can be expected from each customer based on their website site visit behaviors. Then, I chose the best preform model to submit on a kaggle competition which only opens for our Data Analytics Fall Term class 2020. We were competing against the others in the class for the best score on the private leaderboard.
I was able to get the model to predict the total sales revenue with 94% accuracy after some feature engineering and turning.</description>
